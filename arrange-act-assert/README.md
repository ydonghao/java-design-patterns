## Also known as
Given/When/Then

## Intent
The Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for organizing unit tests.
It breaks tests down into three clear and distinct steps:
1. Arrange: Perform the setup and initialization required for the test.
2. Act: Take action(s) required for the test.
3. Assert: Verify the outcome(s) of the test.

## Applicability
Use Arrange/Act/Assert pattern when

* you need to structure your unit tests so they're easier to read, maintain, and enhance.
